After studying Korean, I realized that we need to start memorizing vocabulary smarter - and developed a tool for this. Design of front and back end. Had to work on web analytics, SEO, cloud, etc. My first big project in **Javascript**.\r\n\r\n**Google Summer of code 2015 Project** - Working with [Dbpedia's](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/) dear [Ruben Verborgh](http://ruben.verborgh.org/)\r\n\r\nExpanding DBpediaâ€™s Linked Data Fragments server to have live updates to a Knowledge Graph stored in binary format of RDF. This project was one of my favorite software development experiences. Required a smart retrieval algorithm and a smart querying algorithm. Also in **Javascript**.\r\n(http://github.com/pabloem/Server.js)\r\n\r\n**Google Summer of Code 2014 Project** - Working with [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) \r\n\r\nCreate algorithm that attempts to predict fault-prone test suites on automatic testing of MariaDB development. Project was in **Python**.
