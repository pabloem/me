Check out [my blog](pabloem.github.io), where I write in English and Spanish about computer science, data analysis and Mexico.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3bFe0V6.jpg\" width=\"250\" align=\"right\">\r\n### Contact\r\n* mail@iampablo.me\r\n* (+82) 10-9746-9742\r\n* [My CV in PDF](http://www.iampablo.me/cv.pdf)\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Contents\r\n* [Education](#education)\r\n* [Interests](#interests)\r\n* [Projects and Open source](#projects-and-open-source)\r\n* [Teaching and mentoring](#teaching-and-mentoring)\r\n* [Professional Experience](#professional-experience)\r\n* [Publications](#publications)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## CV\r\n### Education\r\n#### [Seoul National University](http://www.snu.ac.kr) - 2013/09 to present\r\n* **MSc in Computational Science and Technology**\r\n* Research: Graph theory, network science, data visualization.\r\n* Advisor: [Kyomin Jung](http://milab.snu.ac.kr/kjung/)\r\n* Working in the Machine Intelligence & Social Network Analysis Lab.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### National University of Mexico - 2006/7 to 2010/12\r\n* **B.S. Computer Engineering**\r\n* Graduated with College Honors. GPA: 9.25/10\r\n* **Thesis project**: Parallel algorithm performance on multicore environments\r\n\r\n#### University of California, Los Angeles - 2009/08 to 2010/01\r\n* **Exchange student of CS** (GPA: 4.0)\r\n\r\n#### Stanford University - 2010/06 to 2010/08\r\n* **Summer quarter CS** (GPA: 3.82).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Interests and experience\r\nInterested in Network science, Graph theory and Data visualization. With experience on Databases, Servers, Back end development, Data analysis, etc.\r\n\r\n### Projects and open source\r\n#### Hanja Explorer (http://www.hanja.me)\r\n* Tool to study and visualize Korean vocabulary using etymological roots. After studying Korean, I realized that we need to start memorizing vocabulary smarter - and developed a tool for this. Design of front and back end. Had to work on web analytics, SEO, cloud, etc. My first big project in **Javascript**.\r\n\r\n#### Google Summer of code 2015 Project - Working with [Dbpedia's](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/) dear [Ruben Verborgh](http://ruben.verborgh.org/)\r\n* Expanding DBpedia’s Linked Data Fragments server to have live updates to a Knowledge Graph stored in binary format of RDF. This project was one of my favorite software development experiences. Required a smart retrieval algorithm and a smart querying algorithm. Also in **Javascript**.\r\n(http://github.com/pabloem/Server.js)\r\n\r\n#### Google Summer of Code 2014 Project - Working with [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) \r\n* Create algorithm that attempts to predict fault-prone test suites on automatic testing of MariaDB development. Project was in **Python**. Great experience.\r\n(github.com/pabloem/Kokiri)\r\n\r\n### Teaching and mentoring\r\n#### Teaching Assistant - Advanced Programming Methodology (2015 Fall Semester)\r\n* All sorts of support for the class such as grading and interacting with students. At Seoul Natl. University.\r\n\r\n#### Instructor - Development and Analysis of Parallel Algorithms (2010 Fall Semester)\r\n* Developed and taught two 15-hour courses on development and analysis of parallel algorithms as part of the activities at the Intel Laboratory at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.\r\n\r\n### Professional experience\r\n#### Google Korea - 2015/01 to 2015/03\r\n* **Software Developer Intern**\r\n* Working in the search team. Specifically, in the Knowledge Graph team. This is the team in charge of the knowledge base that Google uses to power its search results (e.g. Google 'beyonce').\r\n* Worked in Seoul, South Korea.\r\n\r\n#### Oracle Advanced Development Center - 2011/01 to 2013/06\r\n* **Software Developer.**\r\n* Working in the Database Scheduler Team. Working on DBMS features in C. Did also some Java and PL/SQL. We were a three-people team that inherited an unstable 500,000+ line codebase, and made it release-stable. Spent also some time working in new features.\r\n* Worked in Guadalajara, Mexico.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n* [“Knowledge  extraction  through  etymological  networks:  Synonym  discovery  in  sino-korean  words,” in Proceedings of the 5th International conference on Information and Knowledge Management (ICIKM 2016).
